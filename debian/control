Description: C++ bindings to libpmemobj
 The C++ bindings provide an easier to use (and thus less error prone
 version) of libpmemobj -- the persistent memory object store -- through
 the implementation of a pmem-resident property, persistent pointers,
 scoped and closure transactions, locking primitives and many others.
 .
 This package contains the development headers.
